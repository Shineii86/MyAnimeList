# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2026-05-07] - Simplified: Auto-Push via Environment Variables

### Changed
- **GitHub credentials now read from environment variables** — `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO` env vars are used automatically as fallback when client doesn't send credentials
- **No manual Settings configuration needed** — set 3 env vars on Vercel once and data persistence works automatically
- Updated `.env.example` with all required variables

### Setup (one-time)
1. Vercel Dashboard → your project → **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
2. Add: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OWNER`, `GITHUB_REPO`
3. Redeploy

## [2026-05-07] - Critical Fix: Persistent Data Storage & Data Recovery

### Fixed
- **Data loss on Vercel** — Root cause: `/tmp` filesystem resets on every serverless cold start, causing all add/edit/delete operations to silently lose data. Fixed by using GitHub API as persistent storage backend.
- **Recovered 257 anime entries** — Data was lost when Vercel's ephemeral `/tmp` wrote back a single-entry state. Restored from git history commit `0a57fdf`.
- **All data mutations now persist** — `addAnime`, `updateAnime`, `deleteAnime` write to GitHub repo via API, not just local filesystem
- **Reads use GitHub as source of truth** — When GitHub credentials are available, reads fetch from `raw.githubusercontent.com` (always up-to-date), falling back to bundled file

### Changed
- **`lib/data.js` completely rewritten** — All CRUD functions are now async, accept optional GitHub credentials (`{token, owner, repo}`), and persist to GitHub
- **`lib/api.js` created** — Client-side helper that auto-attaches GitHub credentials from localStorage settings to every API request via `x-github-token`, `x-github-owner`, `x-github-repo` headers
- **All 8 API routes updated** — Extract GitHub credentials from request headers/body via `getGhFromReq()` and pass to data layer
- **All 10 client pages updated** — Use `apiGet`/`apiPost`/`apiPut`/`apiDelete` instead of raw `fetch` to automatically include credentials
- **Zero external dependencies** — GitHub API calls use native Node.js `https` module only

### Technical
- Data flow: Client → `apiFetch` (adds GH headers) → API route → `getGhFromReq(req)` → `readData(gh)` / `writeData(data, gh)` → GitHub API
- Fallback chain: GitHub API → `/tmp` cache → bundled `data/anime.json` → empty state
- `readDataSync()` preserved for legacy sync callers (uses local cache only)
- GitHub credentials stored in `localStorage` as `mal_admin_settings` (client-side only, never leaked)

### Required Setup
- **Enable Settings → Auto-Push** with your GitHub token, owner, and repo name — this is now required for data persistence on Vercel

## [2026-05-07] - UI Overhaul: Professional SVG Icons Replace Emojis

### Changed
- **Replaced all emoji icons with SVG components** across 13 page files and 1 shared icon library
- Created `lib/icons.js` — 35+ reusable SVG icon components (Heroicons-style, 20x20 default, inherit currentColor)
- **Dashboard** (`pages/index.js`) — star ratings, status cards, quick action buttons, genre tags, recent table
- **Login** (`pages/login.js`) — unlock icon on sign-in button
- **Activity Log** (`pages/activity.js`) — action-specific icons (add/edit/delete/push/import/login/settings), timeline dots, empty state
- **Push to GitHub** (`pages/push.js`) — document and rocket icons for step headers and buttons
- **Settings** (`pages/settings.js`) — settings/gear, rocket, tag, save, download/upload, checkmark icons
- **Random Picker** (`pages/random.js`) — dice, target filter, star ratings, note icons
- **All Anime** (`pages/anime/index.js`) — grid/list toggle, plus, search, edit, trash, star scores, filter icons
- **Add Anime** (`pages/anime/add.js`) — search, edit, star, plus, note icons on form labels and buttons
- **Edit Anime** (`pages/anime/[id].js`) — save, note, star icons
- **Bulk Import** (`pages/bulk-import.js`) — box, link, search, clipboard, rocket icons
- **AniList Search** (`pages/anilist.js`) — search, star, plus icons
- **Analytics** (`pages/analytics.js`) — chart, star, TV, tag, list, rocket, checkmark icons

### Technical
- All icons use `stroke="currentColor"` — automatically match theme colors
- Icons scale via `size` prop (default 20px)
- Both outline (`Icon`) and solid (`IconSolid`) variants available
- Activity log action icons mapped via `ACTIVITY_ACTION_ICONS` constant
- Page bundle sizes increased ~1-3KB each (SVG paths are lightweight)
- Zero external icon library dependencies — pure inline SVG

## [2026-05-07] - Fix: Vercel Read-Only Filesystem Crash

### Fixed
- **Critical: Login crash on Vercel** — `addEntry()` in auth route threw unhandled error when writing `activity-log.json` to Vercel's read-only filesystem, causing "Internal server error" on every login attempt
- **Activity log write safety** — `lib/activity-log.js` `writeLog()` now catches filesystem errors silently instead of crashing
- **Data write safety** — `lib/data.js` `writeData()` now catches filesystem errors silently
- **Vercel /tmp support** — Both `data.js` and `activity-log.js` detect `VERCEL` env var and use `/tmp` (writable) instead of `data/` (read-only)
- **Data seeding** — On first read, if `/tmp` is empty, data is seeded from the bundled `data/anime.json` so the admin panel has content to display

### Technical
- `IS_VERCEL = !!process.env.VERCEL` — Vercel sets this automatically, no config needed
- On Vercel: reads from bundled `data/anime.json`, writes to `/tmp/anime.json`
- On local: reads/writes from `data/` as before — no behavior change for local dev
- Activity log is ephemeral on Vercel (lost on cold start) — use GitHub push for persistence

## [2026-05-07] - Security & Stability Fixes — Full Diagnostic Sweep

### Fixed
- **Critical: Hardcoded password fallback removed** — `lib/auth.js` no longer falls back to `anime-admin-2026` when `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var is missing. Auth now fails closed (no access without env var configured)
- **Critical: JWT secret cold-start fix** — `lib/auth.js` now derives a deterministic secret from `ADMIN_PASSWORD` when `JWT_SECRET` is not set, so tokens survive serverless cold starts instead of being randomly regenerated each restart
- **Auth cookie production fix** — `pages/api/auth.js` now adds `Secure` flag on Vercel/production environments so cookies work over HTTPS
- **Error handling added** — `pages/api/auth.js` and `pages/api/activity.js` now wrap handlers in try/catch like all other API routes
- **Serverless path fix** — `lib/data.js` and `lib/activity-log.js` now use `__dirname`-relative paths instead of `process.cwd()` which is unreliable in Vercel's standalone output
- **Removed production console.log** — `lib/readme-generator.js` no longer logs to stdout in production

### Changed
- **CJS consistency** — `lib/auto-push.js` converted from ESM (`export`) to CJS (`module.exports`) to match all other `lib/` modules
- **`.env.example` updated** — Added `JWT_SECRET` generation command and marked both vars as required with notes about cold-start behavior

### Technical
- When `JWT_SECRET` is not set, secret is derived as `SHA-256(ADMIN_PASSWORD)` — deterministic across cold starts, unique per password
- When neither `ADMIN_PASSWORD` nor `JWT_SECRET` is set, auth is completely disabled with console.error warning
- All 36 JS files pass syntax check, build passes clean (14 routes, 0 errors)

## [2026-05-07] - Fix Vercel Build — Broken Import Paths

### Fixed
- **Fixed incorrect relative import paths** in 3 API route files that caused Vercel build failure
  - `pages/api/activity.js` — `../../../lib/` → `../../lib/` (2 levels up, not 3)
  - `pages/api/push.js` — `../../../lib/` → `../../lib/` for all 5 imports
  - `pages/api/stats.js` — `../../../lib/` → `../../lib/` for all 3 imports
- Root cause: `pages/api/*.js` files are 2 levels from `admin-panel/` root, but imports used `../../../` (3 levels) which resolved outside the project directory
- Files in subdirectories (`pages/api/anime/`, `pages/api/anilist/`) already had correct `../../../` paths (3 levels deep)

### Technical
- Verified all 14 API route files have correct import paths
- `pages/api/auth.js` was already correct (`../../lib/`)
- No functional changes, only path resolution fix

## [2026-05-07] - Admin Panel v1.3.1 — Live Stats

### Changed

  - Total Anime: computed from array length
  - TV/Movie/OVA/ONA counts: computed from type field
  - Average Score: computed from all scores
  - Completion Rate: computed from status field
  - Stats table includes TV Shows, OVAs, ONA rows
- **Dashboard shows 6 stat cards** — Total Anime, Avg Score, TV Shows, Movies, OVAs, Completion Rate
- **Stats API returns computed stats** — score distribution, type breakdown, status counts

### Technical
- `computeStats()` function in readme-generator.js computes all stats from anime array
- Stats API uses real-time computation instead of stored metadata
- README badge dynamically shows actual anime count

## [2026-05-07] - Admin Panel v1.3.0 — Activity Log

### Added
- **Activity Log** — Full audit trail of every action in the admin panel
  - Timeline view grouped by date with colored dots and icons
  - Tracks: add, edit, delete, push, import, generate, login events
  - Shows what changed (score 7→9, status Completed→Watching, etc.)
  - Search and filter by action type
  - Pagination (30 per page)
  - Clear log button
  - Stored in `data/activity-log.json` (max 500 entries, auto-trimmed)
- **Logging integrated into all API routes**
  - `POST /api/anime` — logs "Added: Title"
  - `PUT /api/anime/[id]` — logs "Edited: Title — score 7→9"
  - `DELETE /api/anime/[id]` — logs "Deleted: Title"
  - `POST /api/push` — logs "Pushed to owner/repo"
  - `POST /api/anime/import` — logs "Imported X entries"
  - `POST /api/auth` — logs "Successful login" or "Failed login attempt"

### Technical
- New `lib/activity-log.js` module with add/get/clear functions
- Activity log API endpoint with filtering and pagination
- Auto-trim to 500 entries to prevent unbounded growth

## [2026-05-07] - Admin Panel v1.2.1 — Diagnostics & Data Cleanup

### Fixed
- **Removed unused dependencies** — `cookie` and `jsonwebtoken` removed from package.json (custom HMAC auth used instead)
- **Added try/catch** to 3 API routes (random, [id], stats) for proper error handling
- **Fixed 73 incorrect AniList IDs** — fetched correct IDs from AniList API via rate-limited batch script
- **Removed duplicate entries** — Hyouka (2x), Love is War (= Kaguya-sama)
- **Fixed Dragon Maid ID** — corrected from 21507 to 21816
- **Added missing data fields** — all 257 entries now have `status`, `notes`, `tags`, `addedAt`, `updatedAt` fields
- **4 entries with placeholder IDs** — Q Transformers, Xiaolin Showdown, Yamada-kun, Zombie Powder (not available on AniList)

### Technical
- Added `scripts/fix-duplicate-ids.js` — batch AniList ID lookup with rate limiting
- Added `scripts/fetch-correct-ids.js` — second-pass ID correction
- Zero true duplicate IDs remaining (aliases are intentional: same anime, different names)
- All 30 JS files pass syntax check, all API routes have error handling
